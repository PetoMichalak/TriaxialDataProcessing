## Introduction

This is a set of R scripts which are used to process a triaxial streams for classification purposes. In this project we've looked at blocking activities such as carrying a suitcase or pushing a pram, which in usual approach mask the actual activity and decrease prediction accuracy. 

## Example usage

There is an example test data in TestCase folder, which can be used to play around with the scripts: TestHip.csv and TestWrist.csv. This represents a raw data without any manipulation except of extraction from binary format. There is also an annotation file included.

Same folder also contains a set of training files with already extracted features (you're welcome). However testing data needs to use all of the blocks in the workflow to produce sensible results. Let's start!

### Synchronise data streams

synchroniseTriaxialStreams.R

### Annotate the datastream

streamAnnotation.R

### Feature extraction

featureExtraction.R

### Classifiers: kNN, SVM, HMM

kNN_twoStreams.R

svm_twoStreams.R

HMMfunction.R

### Data evaluation

dataEvaluation.R

## Stream fragmentation

There is also a set of enhanced scripts which use parallelization and stream fragmentation concepts in 'splitting' directory.
